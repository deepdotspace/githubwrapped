/**
 * Subscription plan declarations.
 *
 * GitHub Wrapped is free and open-source with no paid plans, so this list is empty and
 * `deepspace deploy` syncs zero plans to Stripe. The scaffold's placeholder
 * "Pro" tier ($9/mo, $90/yr) was never wired to any UI and is removed rather
 * than left to sync a product nobody can buy.
 *
 * To add a plan later: each entry needs a stable `slug`, a `name`, and
 * `priceCents` (free plans use 0 and never hit Stripe).
